# Extractive-Text-Summarization
This repository contains the code and resources for my project on extractive text summarization using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). The project involves developing a model to summarize long pieces of text by extracting the most relevant sentences, leveraging the power of RBMs for feature learning and dimensionality reduction.  

Technologies Used:

Python
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
TensorFlow/PyTorch (for RBM implementation)
